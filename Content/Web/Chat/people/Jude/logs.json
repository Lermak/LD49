        {  "time": "2:59 PM","to_msg": "Of course not. I told them to stop gossiping and disengaged with them."},
        {  "time": "3:00 PM","from_msg": "Good. I’ll have a talk with them and remind them that we have a no-tolerance policy regarding harassment. That should get them to stop snooping. Thanks for letting me know. Gotta run!"}

		{  "time": "2:50 PM","from_msg": "I need to get back to work. I hid the file in my DigiPet. It’s safe there. To access the file, you need to do these actions with the DigiPet in the following order: wash it, feed it (2 times), play with it, feed it. Let me know if you have any questions."},
		{  "time": "2:50 PM","to_msg": "I don’t appreciate your attitude here, Kailee. As you may remember, I’ve been at this company much longer than you and Delores trusts me implicitly. There are many people I could have trusted with this highly sensitive information but I chose you. Perhaps you should reconsider what tone you use with me going forward. I think it would be wise for you to work on your communication skills. It would be a shame for your deficiencies in this area to be held against you in your next performance review."}

		{  "time": "10:29 AM","to_msg": "I would rather not as she is very busy. Can you just find them and send them to me?"},
		{  "time": "1:48 PM","from_msg": "I’m very busy, too. I’m not your administrative assistant and this is not my job. If you won’t ask Delores, even though this is supposedly for some project for her, you should ask Aida. She keeps track of everything."},

		{  "time": "4:16 PM","from_msg": "Music and video games are my passions. I also volunteer at the local animal shelter. I love animals and helping out where I can."},

		{  "time": "4:37 PM","to_msg": "Actually, I would be happy to take you there. Are you free Friday night? We could see a movie or walk along the lakefront after dinner. We could also go back to my place since I have a penthouse apartment with an excellent view of the mountains."},
		{  "time": "4:55 PM","from_msg": "Oh, um, wow. Thanks for the offer but I actually have a boyfriend. He’s the reason I moved up here. We’ve been together for over a year now. But thanks again for the offer- I’m flattered."},
		{  "time": "4:55 PM","to_msg": "I think there has been a miscommunication here. I was merely offering to take you there as a co-worker and nothing more. Since I hold positions of responsibility here and you are a new employee, I thought you might want some advice on your career goals."},

		{  "time": "3:44 PM","to_msg": "Excellent. I noticed you still have not uploaded a profile picture to the employee directory. I think it is always a good idea to do that, especially when working remotely, so that your co-workers have a better idea of their fellow teammates."},

		{  "time": "4:48 PM","to_msg": "Yes, I know. Perhaps it would be better if we met outside of work. We could go to dinner, my treat. I dabble in photography so after dinner we could go back to my apartment and I could take some pictures of you for your profile."},
