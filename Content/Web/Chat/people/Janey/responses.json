    "I'd love to chat with you, newbie, but I've got my heat level rising. See ya!",
    "Hey newbie. Message me again later because I'm really busy right now. Soz!",
	"Can't chat now, sorry!",
	"(AFK) Feeding my frog. Back soon!",
	"(AFK) Playing a quick game of Lucha or Lose It. Leave a message!",
	"Kailee is really nice. I went out for drinks with her, Christopher, Tim, and Adrian. We have some really cool people here!",
	"You know, Jude is kind of a jerk. I'd say this to his face, too. And how is he affording a YACHT? He thinks he's so much better than everyone else and I'm sick of it. We all are.",
