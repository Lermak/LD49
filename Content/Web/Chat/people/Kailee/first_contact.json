Also Mr. Spoons has gotten SO BIG since you last saw him- he's like double the size since he was a kitten! He's still a huge snuggle bug though so I know he'll jump right on your lap to get your world-famous snuggles. Well, world-famous to me anyway. :) I MISS YOUR HUGS! You give such amazing hugs! I've just missed you so much!"
