    "HEYYYYYY!! Christopher told me you were coming to work here but I didn't know it would be so soon!",
    "It's been way too long since we've seen each other. We should hang out soon! Christopher has these awesome gummies that you really need to try. The three of us can eat them and hang out just like after we shipped a game when we were in school. I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE HERE!",
	"Also Mr. Spoons has gotten SO BIG since you last saw him- he's like double the size since he was a kitten! He's still a huge snuggle bug though so I know he'll jump right on your lap to get your world-famous snuggles. Well, world-famous to me anyway. :) ",
 	"*BIG HUGS!* I've just missed you so much! We need to hang out so I can give you real hugs. We can get Christopher and do our legendary cuddle huddles! :) "
