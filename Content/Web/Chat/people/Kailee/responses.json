    "Hihi! I found the cutest cat cake recipe on Good Food Stories. By cat cake, I mean a cake FOR CATS! Isn’t that the coolest? Now this is only a treat so don’t go making this as your cat’s main food every day, okay?? \n 1 5oz. can Albacore tuna in water with NO SALT added \n ½ cup finely diced cooked chicken \n ½ cup sweet potato puree \n Rice flour \n Potato, mashed \n Line a small rimmed baking sheet with waxed paper. Open the tuna can. Drain the tuna of any water, then scoop the tuna into a medium mixing bowl. Flake the tuna into small bits. \n Add the diced chicken to the bowl, then stir in the sweet potato puree- add just enough to keep the mixture together. You may not need the entire 1/2 cup. If your sweet potato is a little loose and watery, add rice flour 1 teaspoon at a time to soak up the excess moisture. \n Place a 1-inch round cookie cutter on a plate and then scoop the mix into the cutter, smoothing it to the edges. Lift the cutter and voila: you have a perfect, little round of “cake.” \n To frost the cake, pipe the mashed potatoes with a pastry bag fitted with a large piping tip or you can just dollop a bit on top. If your cat doesn’t like potatoes, you can use meat puree mixed with a little bit of the rice flour to stiffen it. Mewjoy!",
    "Did you know that the first recorded cat name we’ve discovered translates to “Sweetie”? It’s true! My friend Helen has a cat named Sweetie and her kitty is soooooo cute. We should all hang out sometime soon!",
    "Sometimes when I get really bored with pressing the button I’ll pretend that I’m an archaeologist and the button is actually how I’m digging up interesting new relics and fossils. Other times I’ll put on my favorite song and jam out to the beat by pressing the button in time with the music. Try it sometime- it makes the day go by so much faster! :)",
